But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well in Brave browser.
Quote Opening Local Folders is Unsupported
Your browser doesn&amp;rsquo;t support opening local folders.You can either open single files or open a remote repository.
Screenshot of the error vscode.dev gives
This support was intentionally removed by the Brave team as they deemed it to be unsafe. See https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/11407.
Solution If you want to disregard the security concerns (do so at your own risk, of course) there is a simple workaround tucked away.</description></item><item><title>How-to: Add a copy-to-clipboard button on hugo for inline code samples</title><link>https://dan.arndt.ca/posts/2022/10/hugo-copy-to-clipboard/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Daniel Arndt</author><guid>https://dan.arndt.ca/posts/2022/10/hugo-copy-to-clipboard/</guid><description>Motivation When I first made my Hugo website, one of the very first things I wanted to do was add a “copy to clipboard” button next to important snippets. My theme came with a copy button for multi-line code snippets, but there was nothing available for inline code like this, i.e. the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; HTML tag. It was pretty important for me to make how-to guides that were as simple and easy to follow as possible, and this was a feature that seemed worth the time to figure out.</description></item><item><title>Enable Wayland support on Chrome / Brave Browser</title><link>https://dan.arndt.ca/posts/2022/10/chrome-brave-browser-wayland-support/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Daniel Arndt</author><guid>https://dan.arndt.ca/posts/2022/10/chrome-brave-browser-wayland-support/</guid><description>Description If you get blurry windows with Chrome or Brave, and you’re using Wayland (the default window manager on Ubuntu), there is an easy fix. Once upon a time you had to edit the launch flags, which was a little more involved, but with more recent versions you can just edit the flag with the built in browser UI.
Solution Just head to chrome://flags/#ozone-platform-hint Copy to clipboard and change the drop down value to auto.</description></item></channel></rss>
