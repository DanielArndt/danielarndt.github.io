My theme came with a copy button for multi-line code snippets, but there was nothing available for inline code like this, i.e. the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; HTML tag.

Once upon a time you had to edit the launch flags, which was a little more involved, but with more recent versions you can just edit the flag with the built in browser UI.
Solution Just head to chrome://flags/#ozone-platform-hint Copy to clipboard and change the drop down value to auto.</description></item></channel></rss>
