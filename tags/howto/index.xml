My theme came with a copy button for multi-line code snippets, but there was nothing available for inline code like this, i.e. the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; HTML tag. It was pretty important for me to make how-to guides that were as simple and easy to follow as possible, and this was a feature that seemed worth the time to figure out.</description></item></channel></rss>
